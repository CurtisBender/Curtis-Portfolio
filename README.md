### Are Consecutive Free Throws Independent Events?
[Publication](https://github.com/CurtisBender/Free-Throws)

Determined how the result of the first free throw affects the probability of making the second free throw using the **pandas** library in **Python**. 

A dataset containing information for over 600 thousand NBA free throws was cleaned and analysed. 

Analysis involved calculating the **p-value**, with the null hypothesis that consecutive free throws are independent events, for each player with a large enough sample of free throw attempts.
