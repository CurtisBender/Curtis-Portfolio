Hi, I’m Curtis Bender and I'm a 3rd year statistics major at the University of Waterloo. I have over a year of co-op experience working in finance, and I’m interested in data analytics and data science. I'm looking to shift over to those fields and gain experience.

You can reach me at c6bender@uwaterloo.ca
